# United-States-Airlines-Analysis
## Objective
Analyzed flight delay patterns and developed a predictive model to identify factors contributing to avoidable delays in U.S. airlines.
Key Responsibilities and Achievements

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

Aggregated data from multiple sources including flight records, airport information, and runway details
Performed web scraping to collect additional airline and passenger traffic data
Conducted thorough missing value analysis and treatment


## Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized delay patterns across airlines and days of the week
Analyzed the impact of flight duration and departure times on delays
Compared delay frequencies between large and medium hub airports


## Statistical Analysis

Conducted hypothesis tests to explore relationships between airport characteristics (altitude, number of runways) and flight delays
Performed correlation analysis of flight delay predictors


## Machine Learning

Developed and compared multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting Classifier
Implemented advanced techniques such as OneHotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, and stratified 5-fold cross-validation
Addressed model overfitting and optimized performance


## Results and Impact

Identified key factors contributing to avoidable flight delays
Created a predictive model to forecast flight delays with average 64.9 accuracy
Provided actionable insights to improve airline scheduling and operations
